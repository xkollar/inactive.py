= Dear reader.

So you are inerested in making this little tool better? Perfect!

Nice things to have:

  * Remove dependency on time library.
  * Some packaging. (egg..., even .deb and .rpm would be nice).

Generally speaking: if you see some smelly code or something
that you think know better how to do... let me know. I would
love to know :-).

== Usage

I personally like to use this tool with mplayer playing
some internet stream, so it stops playing when I leave
the computer for some time (unnecessary traffic waste).

  $ inactive.py $((60*5)) mplayer -playlist http://jungletrain.net/24kbps.m3u

If you find other use for the tool, please let me know :-).

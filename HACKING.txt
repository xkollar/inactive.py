= Dear reader.

So you are interested in making this little tool better? Perfect!

Nice things to have:

  * Remove dependency on time library.
  * Some packaging. (egg..., even .deb and .rpm would be nice).

Generally speaking: if you see some smelly code or something
that you think know better how to do... let me know. I would
love to know :-).

== Usage

I personally like to use this tool with mplayer playing
some internet stream, so it stops playing when I leave
the computer for some time (unnecessary traffic waste).

  $ inactive.py $((60*5)) mplayer -playlist http://jungletrain.net/24kbps.m3u

If you find other use for the tool, please let me know :-)

== Licencing

Lately many people around successful projects published under
"permissive more that GPL" licenses started to moan in reaction
to fact, that some companies started to use their code but never
contributed anything back. I would like to prevent such situations
and therefore I have chosen GPLv3.

== Code

Code shall pas pep8, with following possible exceptions
(more may be added or some may be removed in the future).

  $ pep8.py --ignore=E221,E302,E203,E201,E241,E128,E124,W391 inactive.py

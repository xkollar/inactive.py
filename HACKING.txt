So you are inerested in making this little tool better? Perfect!

Nice things to have:

  * Remove dependency on time library.
  * Some packaging. (egg..., even .deb and .rpm would be nice).

Generally speaking: if you see some smelly code or something
that you think know better how to do... let me know. I would
love to know :-).
